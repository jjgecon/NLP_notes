      "Comment:  After 40 years of being straight, how could I now find myself interested in people of the same sex? I have had a few same sex encounters of my own doing.\n",
      "Response:  Sexuality is normally formed during adolescence. It would be extremely rare for someone to develop feelings of same-sex attraction later in life. I would explore whether the attraction you are experiencing is sexually-based or intimacy-based. Perhaps you are craving a close, emotionally intimate relationship with the same-sex, but have somehow sexualized that desire. People often short-cut emotional intimacy for sexual intimacy. This would be something to explore with a counselor.\n",
      "Rating:  2\n",
      "Definition:  Appropriateness in this context refers to the mental health professional's ability to respond empathetically and supportively while addressing the patient's confusion about their sexuality. The response should foster a safe space for exploration rather than make assumptions based solely on generalizations about sexual development.\n",
      "Confidence:  70\n",
      "Cot:  [\"The professional's response attempts to explain the nature of sexuality development, which could be informative but might come off as dismissive of the patient's unique experience.\", \"The suggestion to explore whether the attraction is sexually-based or intimacy-based is a valid point; however, it may undermine the patient's feelings by implying there is a 'right' way to interpret their experiences.\", \"By stating it's 'extremely rare' for same-sex attraction to develop later in life, the professional may inadvertently invalidate the patient's current feelings and experiences, which can be damaging.\", 'The recommendation to work with a counselor is fine, but it may leave the patient feeling unsupported in the moment; a better response would include immediate validation of their feelings.']\n",

      "Comment:  I've pretty much been on my own since day one, I'm a middle child of five, and I can't seem to put my trust in anyone. It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.\n",
      "Response:  One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate.  You'll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of self-reminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work.\n",
      "Rating:  1\n",
      "Definition:  Appropriate responses should be empathetic, relevant to the patient's concerns, and offer constructive guidance or support for their emotional and relational struggles rather than general advice about concentration.\n",
      "Confidence:  80\n",
      "Cot:  ['The patient mentioned trust issues and difficulty with emotions in relationships, seeking help for these specific problems.', \"The mental health professional's response focused incorrectly on concentration techniques instead of addressing the patient's concerns with trust and relationships.\", \"An appropriate response would acknowledge the patient's feelings, validate their experiences, and discuss ways to build trust or manage feelings more effectively.\", \"There is a disconnect between the patient's stated problems and the response given, leading to a low rating for appropriateness.\"]\n",

I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?\n",
      "Response:  Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!\n",
      "Rating:  2\n",
      "Definition:  Appropriate responses often provide empathy, validation, and practical steps for treatment or support. They should create a safe environment for the patient to express their feelings and seek help.\n",
