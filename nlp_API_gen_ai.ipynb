      "Comment:  I've pretty much been on my own since day one, I'm a middle child of five, and I can't seem to put my trust in anyone. It took me four years to finally open up a little to my best friend. Every time I realize that I have feelings for someone, I freak out and never talk to them again. I really want some help.\n",
      "Response:  One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention back.Start with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate.  You'll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer ones.Once you start seeing your success, this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrate.The task of self-reminding is the same, whether for long or short time periods.Also, before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problem.If there is, then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate, and not some medical reason preventing this.Before someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work.\n",
      "Rating:  1\n",
      "Definition:  The appropriateness of a mental health professional's response hinges on their ability to address the patient's specific concerns empathetically and effectively. A response is considered appropriate if it is relevant, shows understanding of the patient's feelings, and provides guidance or support directly tailored to the issues presented by the patient.\n",

I lose control of myself and become angry and anxious and just eat and purge. Over and over. Can someone please point me in the right direction for help?\n",
      "Response:  Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is, whether they are good enough compared with anyone else, and whether the way they person lives is effective.If you have a style you're already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics, keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself, which usually takes place gradually, from these sort of self-doubts.The other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where you'd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problem.Good luck in your studies!\n",
      "Rating:  2\n",
      "Definition:  Appropriateness refers to the relevance, empathy, and effectiveness of the mental health professional's response to the patient's concern about their bulimia.
